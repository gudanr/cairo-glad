/**
 * cairo_dwrite_font_face_create_for_dwrite_fontface:
 * @dwrite_font_face: A pointer to an #IDWriteFontFace specifying the
 * DWrite font to use.
 *
 * Creates a new font for the DWrite font backend based on a
 * DWrite font face. This font can then be used with
 * cairo_set_font_face() or cairo_scaled_font_create().

 * Here is an example of how this function might be used:
 * <informalexample><programlisting><![CDATA[
 * #include <cairo-win32.h>
 * #include <dwrite.h>
 *
 * IDWriteFactory* dWriteFactory = NULL;
 * HRESULT hr = DWriteCreateFactory(
 *     DWRITE_FACTORY_TYPE_SHARED,
 *     __uuidof(IDWriteFactory),
 *    reinterpret_cast<IUnknown**>(&dWriteFactory));
 *
 * IDWriteFontCollection *systemCollection;
 * hr = dWriteFactory->GetSystemFontCollection(&systemCollection);
 *
 * UINT32 idx;
 * BOOL found;
 * systemCollection->FindFamilyName(L"Segoe UI Emoji", &idx, &found);
 *
 * IDWriteFontFamily *family;
 * systemCollection->GetFontFamily(idx, &family);
 *
 * IDWriteFont *dwritefont;
 * DWRITE_FONT_WEIGHT weight = DWRITE_FONT_WEIGHT_NORMAL;
 * DWRITE_FONT_STYLE style = DWRITE_FONT_STYLE_NORMAL;
 * hr = family->GetFirstMatchingFont(weight, DWRITE_FONT_STRETCH_NORMAL, style, &dwritefont);
 *
 * IDWriteFontFace *dwriteface;
 * hr = dwritefont->CreateFontFace(&dwriteface);
 *
 * cairo_font_face_t *face;
 * face = cairo_dwrite_font_face_create_for_dwrite_fontface(dwriteface);
 * cairo_set_font_face(cr, face);
 * cairo_set_font_size(cr, 70);
 * cairo_move_to(cr, 100, 100);
 * cairo_show_text(cr, "ðŸ˜ƒ");
 * ]]></programlisting></informalexample>
 *
 * Return value: a newly created #cairo_font_face_t. Free with
 *  cairo_font_face_destroy() when you are done using it.
