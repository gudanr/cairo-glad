Cairo Solution for Visual Studio 2012 is free software.

Every file of the solution, including the only header file
cairo-features.h is available under the terms of either the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or the Mozilla Public
License (MPL) version 1.1. 

See the following files in this directory for the precise terms and
conditions of either license:

	COPYING-LGPL-2.1
	COPYING-MPL-1.1

I could also distribute this solution as public domain but cairo itself
is distributed under the terms of the LGPL and MPL so nobody would gain
anything with it.
